Last year when I activated the [Robert H. Treman State Park](https://pota.app/#/park/US-2127)
I *meant* to activate this park (named after Treman's son Allan), but being the idiot that I am,
I punched in the wrong address. I had fun anyway Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯

Allan H Treman park features a large marina, but people also come here to fish and birdwatch. A prominent
osprey nest towers over the birdwatching trail: if you're lucky you can catch ospreys circling overhead.
Consider bringing headphones to limit the noise that could interfere with birdwatching activities. It's
usually very chill and there are plenty of picnic tables and benches. A well maintained dog park on
premises is great, if you want to tire your dog out before settling down for an activation. There is a large
parking lot, but it lacks convenient space to deploy a sloper. For vehicle activation I recommend bringing
a standalone antenna.

The park has great cell reception and I got good APRS coverage throughout the park via W2CXM. Thanks to Amateur
Radio Club at Cornell for running this service.

The conditions were decent and although I didn't grab any P2P contacts, I was reached by a number of DX
stations: Thomas (ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª  SM3NRY) and Jean Baptiste (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·  F4ILH) who are avid hunters and regular callers, plus new contacts
with Patrice (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·  F4HGU) and Pasquale (ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹  IK1SOW). Thanks for hunting!
