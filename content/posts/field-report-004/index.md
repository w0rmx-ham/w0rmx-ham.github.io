This was my first activation at the Taughannock Falls State Park. It's a large park that offers
a ton of activation options. There are quite a few parking spots by trees, making car activation
convenient, but you will also find many picnic tables, pavilions, trails, and a ton of open space.
Note that there is a vehicle entrance fee, and the shelters may be reserved ahead of the time.

It was freezing with strong gusts of wind, so I decided to activate in the car. The ground was
frozen, but soft enough to secure two stakes; the antenna installation held up well in the wind.
Surprisingly, I failed to reach the digipeater and iGate in nearby Ithaca, despite the clear shot
and consistent receipt of their beacons. Your mileage may vary, but due to spotty APRS and cell
coverage I strongly recommend scheduling the activation in advance, as you may not be able to
reliably spot yourself while you're in the field.

The activation was very smooth and conditions were favorable. The pileup happened soon after I called
CQ on 20m and in the next hour I clocked a little over 60 QSOs. Lots of P2P callers again, huge thanks to
