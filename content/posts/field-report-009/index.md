I was passing through Vermont this weekend, and thought it would be a good
opportunity for me to finally get back on air. The Quechee State Park was
along my route and I was glad I stopped there: it's a beautiful park with
lots to do and the staff is very helpful. The small day pass fee is totally
worth it.

I was in a bit of a rush, so I didn't have time to hike to the Quechee gorge,
which is apparently the deepest in the state. Fortunately for me, the parking
lot by the entrance had lots of trees, so the antenna deployment was straightforward.
If you're looking for a quick activation this park is a great option. Keep in mind
that the space in the lot is limited, so a car activation may not always be possible.

The park offers decent APRS coverage. I was able to access APRS services by bouncing
my signal via W1UWS-1 to a number of local gates, but it will probably take a few
retransmissions to get the job done. I was unable to get my beacons out, which I
suspect is an issue with my setup.

The conditions were great, but as is tradition I've picked the worst time to return
from hiatus: the IARU world championship was running this weekend. The bands were
packed to the brim; luckily I was still able to successfully activate the park.
