I was lucky enough to get a free weekend in New Hampshire, so I decided to
place a New Hampshire pin on my POTA map. Gardner Memorial State Park is
located near Wilmot, NH in the Gile State Forest (which is also a POTA park).
The location is beautiful and although parking is somewhat limited, I had no
issues finding a spot. Car activation is possible, but there are also a few
picnic tables right by the trail head. There are plenty of trees to deploy
an antenna. The water in the nearby brook is boggy and slow moving, so don't
forget to bring the bug spray!

Cell reception is completely dead in the area. I ended up hiking the Butterfield
Pond trail until I found a single bar to spot myself. Don't rely on it though, I
just got lucky. APRS coverage is also very weak - I was able to get a few of my
beacons out to N3LLO-2 gate, however I could not reliably access APRS services.
Consider scheduling the activation ahead of the time and/or spotting over HF.

The conditions were alright, but the activation went very smoothly and I was getting
decent signal reports. Lovely park and a great option for a quick 2fer if you happen
to be in the neighborhood.

Thanks to the P2P calls:
