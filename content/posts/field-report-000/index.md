Conditions were good, but I totally forgot about the 10m contest
until I turned on the radio! After getting a single contact on 10m
I switched to 15m and had some luck there, including an S2S with
KX0R on [Sheep Mountain](https://www.sotadata.org.uk/en/summit/W0C/FR-097) in CO
and a S2P with NS1C at [Wompatuck State Park](https://pota.app/#/park/US-2465) in
MA. Thanks for calling me George and Ken! Not as many contacts as my first time on
this summit (pictures from both activations included), but I had fun! :)
