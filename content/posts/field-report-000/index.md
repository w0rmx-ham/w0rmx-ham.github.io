Conditions were good, but I totally forgot about the 10m contest until I got to the peak and turned on
the radio! I gave up on 10m after getting a single contact in 40 minutes, but found some luck on other
bands, including an S2S with KX0R on [Sheep Mountain](https://www.sotadata.org.uk/en/summit/W0C/FR-097)
in CO and a S2P with NS1C at [Wompatuck State Park](https://pota.app/#/park/US-2465) in MA. Thanks for
calling me George and Ken! Not as many contacts as my last time on this summit (pictures from both
activations included), but I had fun anyway! :)
