This was my first activation at the Conway-Robinson Memorial State Forest. There are a number of activation
options in the area: plenty of picnic tables, a shelter, and trees close enough to the parking to enable car
activation. The trees by the picnic area and parking are quite tall, but I spotted a few good branches for
antenna deployment. The downside is that you'll be right by a busy road. I didn't look too closely, but the 
shelter looked a bit far from trees, so plan to bring some antenna support or a longer coax. I opted to go for
a hike and activate in the forest. I've heard the trails can get quite muddy, but thankfully today they were dry
which made for a pleasant and easy hike. The forest has solid APRS coverage. To the west you can reach W4VA-13
iGate directly, and to the east you can bounce your signal to W4VA-13 via KN4IJF-1 digipeater. I had no issues
reaching APRS services and getting my beacon out throughout my hike and activation. The activation itself was fun
and the weather was bearable if it wasn't for the brutal wind (or maybe I'm just an idiot for not wearing gloves).
Started off with a few DX calls - Ignacio EA2BD from Spain, who is a regular caller and a new contact with Paul
G4PVM from Chelmsford, Essex in England. Thanks for calling guys! Fun fact - Chelmsford is considered the birthplace
of radio - this is where Marconi made the first radio broadcast. Also got a couple of P2P contacts - thanks for calling!
