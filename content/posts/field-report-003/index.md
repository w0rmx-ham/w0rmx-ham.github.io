At this point about 3/4 of my ham radio contacts have been out of the Wolf Trap National Park,
so the station deployment is pretty routine. Lots of P2P action during this activation, thanks
everyone for calling/answering! I was able  to contact Jim WB0RLJ at the
[US-4011 Chalco Hills State Recreation Area](https://pota.app/#/park/US-4011) twice, reaching the 20
contacts required for the repeat offender award. Thanks Jim for always being on the air! I mean
that literally, this park is on the air every day thanks to Jim. Six other P2P contacts were:

- Joseph KI5WWT at the [US-2996 Cedar Hill State Park](https://pota.app/#/park/US-2996)
- David N4IN at the [US-1267 My Old Kentucky Home State Park](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1267)
- Randy WJ0L at the [US-2504 Lake Maria State Park](https://pota.app/#/park/US-2504)
- Ant NU1U at the [US-1693 Machimoodus State Park](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1693)
- Chas NK8O at the [US-7922 Clinton State Wildlife Area](https://pota.app/#/park/US-7922)
- Jeff K9JP at the [US-0346 Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge](https://pota.app/#/park/US-0346)
