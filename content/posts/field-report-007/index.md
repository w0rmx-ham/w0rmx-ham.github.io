Great weather and good conditions, which means I'm spending the evening at Wolf Trap! Despite the
relatively warm weather, the ground was frozen solid. Staking the antenna was a struggle, so I ended
up setting the stake in the snow. It was a bit precarious, but worked out. Fun activation,
extra thanks to the P2P contacts:
