It's been a while since I've set up at Wolf Trap in the snow. The deployment was straightforward,
conditions were great, and the activation was fun, except for getting stepped on a few times (but that's
just QRP life). Also, noticing an unpleasant trend among some hunters lately, so here is a PSA for non-DX hunters
operating QRO: sending your callsign 6 times unsolicited (yes, this actually happened) doesn't help anybody.
Offsetting your XIT frequency and sending it twice is plenty to break through. If you don't get called first,
it's likely because I'm trying to pick out a weaker station before I lose it.

I was happy to get some P2P contacts and a call from Manu (WP4TZ) in Puerto Rico, thank you guys! I also
enjoyed a visit from a curious fox, which unfortunately I didn't have time to capture on camera. P2P contacts were:

- Jim WB0RLJ at the [US-4011 Chalco Hills State Recreation Area](https://pota.app/#/park/US-4011)
- Chris W4MPT at the [US-3723 Pickett's Mill Battlefield State Historic Site](https://pota.app/#/park/US-3723)
- Jim WT5O at the [US-3568 Silver Strand State Beach](https://pota.app/#/park/US-3568)
- Tripp N4NTO at the [US-6956 Tar River State Game Land](https://pota.app/#/park/US-6956)
