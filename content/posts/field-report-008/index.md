The snow has melted, temps are above freezing, and yet the ground at Wolf Trap refuses
to accept my stake. I was short on time, so I had to get creative. I'll let the picture
speak for itself.

The conditions were excellent and the activation was a ton of fun. First P2P call was
from Christoph DL1CR from a 2fer location southwest of Hanover. Thanks for calling,
Christoph! Another exciting contact was a call from Tom K4SWL, whose [blog](https://qrper.com)
and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@ThomasK4SWL) inspired me to get into POTA and QRP
CW operation. Thanks, Tom!

On a less positive note, I've finally burned a hole in my CHA LEFS 4010 antenna wire. I've had
several thousand QSOs with this antenna. Had I been more careful, it would have been many
thousands more. Actually, it's not beyond repair, but I've been itching to shop for new
Chameleon gear and a replacement wire is the perfect alibi.

Big thanks to all P2P calls:
