Started my 50th activation at the Wolf Trap National Park with a bang, reaching Daniel HB9IIO/P
all the way in [CH-0039](https://pota.app/#/park/CH-0039), a park in Switzerland just north of
Lausanne. Thank you Daniel for picking me out of the mud! Conditions were clearly excellent, as
I proceeded to get 8 DX calls within the hour. Thanks to calls from Jouni OH2LIO and Pasi OH1HM,
I can finally place a tack on Finland - thanks guys! Other highlights include a call from W1AW
and following P2P:

- Teri KO4WFP at the  [Savannah National Wildlife Refuge](https://pota.app/#/park/US-0522)
- Tom KS4CR at the [Paris Mountain State Park](https://pota.app/#/park/US-2909)
- Ken K4KVC at the [Panasoffkee Outlet State Conservation Area](https://pota.app/#/park/US-6455)
- James KE8PZN at the [Camp Creek State Park](https://pota.app/#/park/US-5584)
