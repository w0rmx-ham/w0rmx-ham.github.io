Another day, another Wolf Trap activation :) We're expecting a snow storm this weekend, so I was glad
to get a chance to operate a bit before the Winter Field Day next weekend. Routine, but fun activation
with some P2P:

- Jeff KB0FIX at the [US-7676 Hardin Conservation Reserve](https://pota.app/#/park/US-7676)
- The Susquehanna Valley Amateur Radio Club W3VPJ at the [US-1413  Ricketts Glen State Park](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1413)
- Steve AA4BW at the [US-2194  Red Top Mountain State Park](https://pota.app/#/park/US-2194)
